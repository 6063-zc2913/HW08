I use the isRedSimilar function to determine the red similarity threshold. Two colors are considered similar in red if the difference between their red components is less than this threshold. The function compares whether the red, green, and blue components of two colors are within their respective similarity thresholds. If so, the function returns true, indicating that the two colors are similar in RGB space; otherwise, it returns false. I changed the red to fluorescent green. 

Then I create a color picker (createColorPicker). Use the isSimilar function to check whether the color of that pixel is similar to the color selected by the user in the color picker. If the colors are similar, set the red component of that pixel to 0, the green component to 255, and the blue component to the value of the randomizeColorsButton. This means that the color selected by the user replaces similarly colored parts of the image.
